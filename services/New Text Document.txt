              The root cause for any muscle & joint problem is the kidney or
              liver respectively. Toning up these vital organs is the aim of the
              therapy along with pain management. Detox techniques, acupressure,
              or acupuncture therapy to restore energy flow through the
              concerned joints by connecting meridians is done. Energy flow
              through the organs and meridians facilitates natural healing
              thereby providing long-term recovery.

              Diabetes has its root cure in stress related work or relationship,
              affecting the pituitary gland and causing TYPE II diabetes which
              is most commonly seen in 90% of the population. Diagnosis will be
              based upon consultation to discover the onset of the disease
              related to the respective shortcomings that the patient might have
              encountered during his life. Treatment will be provided based on
              the tragic incidences and experiences, such as trauma, that the
              patient is experiencing.

              The root cause of BP is related to the emotions associated with
              the Heart and Blood vessels, such as impatience and hatred
              according to TCM (Traditional Medicine). For instance, a homemaker
              hastily multitasking to prepare her family to start the day is
              mostly impatient since she needs to meet the respective demands of
              the family members while maintaining punctuality. Trying to
              complete a task within a stipulated time makes the person
              impatient, leading to Hypertonic Heart resulting in Blood Pressure
              (BP). The goal of the treatment is to wean off impatience through
              flower remedies and lifestyle modifications, aiming to calm the
              mind.

              Sneezing All lung disorders have their root cause in “lung excess”
              or “lung deficient” functioning; hence the aim of the treatment is
              to balance and healthify the organ to facilitate deep breathing
              which eventually corrects the symptoms and the disease that the
              patient is suffering from.

              Thoughts, emotions, imagination, creativity, happiness, sadness,
              fear, anxiety, conscious and subconscious mind, etc., are all
              unseen elements of a person's mind which circulate on the surface
              of the brain rather than inside the brain. For instance,
              depression is a feeling embedded in the subconscious mind. The
              person is unable to raise the emotion to the conscious level of
              the mind to facilitate reasoning, eventually leading to idleness
              and overall weakness of mind and body. The aim of the treatment is
              to treat the underlying cause of the problem via flower essence
              that works on the subtle anatomy of the body which is the mind.

              This condition most commonly occurs to those whose minds never
              cease to think; these thoughts are involuntarily, and so the
              patient is unable to control them, leading to sleepless nights.
              Treatment involves cessation of involuntary or compulsive thoughts
              via flower remedy allowing the patient to sleep peacefully.

              Gut problems arise due to poor lifestyle habits like eating
              between meals, combining water with food intake, and lack of
              sufficient time gap between meals. Correcting these simple habits
              can relieve the problem while other related gut issues are most
              effectively treated through powerful acupressure/acupuncture
              points that offer near-permanent recovery. Psychological effects
              on the gut include anxiety and fear causing IBS and bloating.
              Thorough diagnosis helps reveal the root cause of the problem to
              facilitate the patient to be free from the present symptoms.
