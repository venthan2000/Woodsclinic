                The root cause for any muscle & joint problem is the kidney or
                liver respectively. Toning up these vital organs is the aim of
                the therapy along with pain management. Detox techniques,
                acupressure, or acupuncture therapy to restore energy flow
                through the concerned joints by connecting meridians is done.
                Energy flow through the organs and meridians facilitates natural
                healing thereby providing long-term recovery.

                Diabetes has its root cure in stress related work or
                relationship, affecting the pituitary gland and causing TYPE II
                diabetes which is most commonly seen in 90% of the population.
                Diagnosis will be based upon consultation to discover the onset
                of the disease related to the respective shortcomings that the
                patient might have encountered during his life. Treatment will
                be provided based on the tragic incidences and experiences, such
                as trauma, that the patient is experiencing.

              <p class="card-text">
                The root cause of BP is related to the emotions associated with
                the Heart and Blood vessels, such as impatience and hatred
                according to TCM (Traditional Medicine). For instance, a
                homemaker hastily multitasking to prepare her family to start
                the day is mostly impatient since she needs to meet the
                respective demands of the family members while maintaining
                punctuality. Trying to complete a task within a stipulated time
                makes the person impatient, leading to Hypertonic Heart
                resulting in Blood Pressure (BP). The goal of the treatment is
                to wean off impatience through flower remedies and lifestyle
                modifications, aiming to calm the mind.

                All lung disorders have their root cause in “lung excess” or
                “lung deficient” functioning; hence the aim of the treatment is
                to balance and healthify the organ to facilitate deep breathing
                which eventually corrects the symptoms and the disease that the
                patient is suffering from.

                Thoughts, emotions, imagination, creativity, happiness, sadness,
                fear, anxiety, conscious and subconscious mind, etc., are all
                unseen elements of a person's mind which circulate on the
                surface of the brain rather than inside the brain. For instance,
                depression is a feeling embedded in the subconscious mind. The
                person is unable to raise the emotion to the conscious level of
                the mind to facilitate reasoning, eventually leading to idleness
                and overall weakness of mind and body. The aim of the treatment
                is to treat the underlying cause of the problem via flower
                essence that works on the subtle anatomy of the body which is
                the mind.

                Treatment involves cessation of involuntary or compulsive
                thoughts via flower remedy allowing the patient to sleep
                peacefully.

              <p class="card-text">
                Gut problems arise due to poor lifestyle habits like eating
                between meals, combining water with food intake, and lack of
                sufficient time gap between meals. Correcting these simple
                habits can relieve the problem while other related gut issues
                are most effectively treated through powerful
                acupressure/acupuncture points that offer near-permanent
                recovery. Psychological effects on the gut include anxiety and
                fear causing IBS and bloating. Thorough diagnosis helps reveal
                the root cause of the problem to facilitate the patient to be
                free from the present symptoms.
